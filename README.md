# altar-of-armok


I will be updating this soon once I get everything organized. basically, using this as a place to drop all of the bits I'm using to tinker with mods. It has been starting to get a little complicated juggling different versions of a ton of text files; I've only been messing with DF RAW mods for about a week so I've still got a lot to learn. 


If anyone has any experience with syndromes/interactions/summons please hit me up; I have tons of questions!
